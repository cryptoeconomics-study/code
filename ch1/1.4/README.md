> This code challenge is a bonus round. It does not build on the prior course work and is not neccessary to understand future course work. That being said, UTXOs are a common thing in the world of cryptoeconomics and blockchains, so we recommend recommend that you explore them.

## UTXOs

Since UTXOs have been around since Bitcoin was first created (2008), there are many great resources on the internet that explain them. There's even Javascript code tutorials and examples that will walk you through how to roll your own. Rather than reinventing the wheel, we're just going to link to a few that we recommend:

### [Blockchain in JS](https://blockchain.nambrot.com/)

A Bitcoin style interactive blockchain demo by [nambrot](https://github.com/nambrot). There's even a [tutorial to build your own](https://github.com/nambrot/blockchain-in-js) so you can recreate the demo.

### [BitcoinJS](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib)

A simple [UTXO example](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/utxo) in Javascript. Their [other repos](https://github.com/bitcoinjs) have lots of great examples as well.

### [How To Code A Bitcoin Blockchain In Javascript](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/code-a-bitcoin-blockchain-in-javascript/)

As advertised, a tutorial on how to code a bitcoin blockchain in javascript. [Blockgeeks](https://blockgeeks.com/) has more great content, so we recommend you check them out if you want a different perspective on many of the concepts explored in this course.
