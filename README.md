# 👾 Coding Project
This repository contains code for the protocols and attacks covered in the Cryptoeconomics.study course. This includes implementing a payment processor blockchain, proof of work, proof of stake, and Plasma.

## Prerequisites

### Command Line Basics

In order to install the packages you need for development you're going to have to know how to navigate around the terminal. 
- [OSX and Linux](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-use-the-command-line-for-apple-macos-and-linux/) 
- [Windows, OSX, and Linux](https://lifehacker.com/a-command-line-primer-for-beginners-5633909)
- [Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/a-beginners-guide-to-the-windows-command-line/)

### NodeJS and NPM

You're going to need *Node.js* and *npm* to complete these assignments. Install both at once [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Git and GitHub

You'll also need a Github account and `git` installed on your computer.

* Create a Github account [here](https://github.com/join).

* Setting up Git:
	* [Download and install the latest version of Git.](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
	* [Set your username in Git.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-your-username-in-git)
	* [Set your commit email address in Git.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address)
	* [Authenticate with Github from Git](https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git#next-steps-authenticating-with-github-from-git)

### Mocha

We're going to be using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) in order to run tests, so install the Mocha package globally by running: 
`npm install -g mocha`

## Local Development Environment

Once you have the prerequisites installed without error, fork [this repository](https://github.com/cryptoeconomics-study/code) ([guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)).
Once you have your own fork at `github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/code`, create a local clone of your fork ([guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo#keep-your-fork-synced)).
`cd` into your local clone and run `npm install` to install all of the required dependencies.

## Technical Difficulties?

Often the first steps are the hardest and we want to make sure you have a great experience learning about cryptoeconomics. If you get stuck or encounter difficulty setting up your development environment please [reach out to the community](https://forum.cryptoeconomics.study/t/technical-difficulties-thread/512). Chances are you're not the only one experiencing difficulties. Reaching out allows us to
- solve your problem directly
- document what the problem was and how we solved it so that in the future people can find those answers quickly
- understand the problem and improve the course material so that it's more intuitive for everyone
It's a win for everyone! So if you get stuck, don't worry about it. Just post your problem on the community forum [technical difficulties thread](https://forum.cryptoeconomics.study/t/technical-difficulties-thread/512) and we'll do our best to help :)

## Taking the Course

Now that you're good to go, let's start the course!

We recommend starting at the beginning of the [Course](https://burrrata.ch/docs/en/getting-started/welcome) with the lecture videos and then trying the coding challenges, but you can also jump straight to the coding challenges [here](https://burrrata.ch/coding-challenges). Whichever path you choose, be aware that they progress sequentially so it's important that you start at the beginning of each chapter and go all the way through. Good luck! 🍀
 
Don't forget to commit your progress to Github as you go. This will create checkpoints that allow you to go back if you made a mistake. It also creates a proof of work (get it... proof of work) that shows you actually went through the course :)
